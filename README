README for TSM - Twitter Subgraph Manipulator by Deen Freelon <dfreelon@gmail.com>

In short, TSM is a Python module that contains a few functions for analyzing Twitter and Twitter-like network data. I wrote it for my own research purposes but thought someone out there might find it useful.

Here are TSM's requirements:
* Python 3.x
* NetworkX (available at http://networkx.github.io/)
* community3.py, a version of Thomas Aynaud's Python implementation of the Louvain method of community detection modified to work with Python 3.x. You can download it from my Github page: https://github.com/dfreelon. The original is available here: http://perso.crans.org/aynaud/communities/   
* tsm.py, the TSM Python module

See tsm.py for a full description of TSM's functions and how to use them. The module should work as long as NetworkX is installed and community3.py and tsm.py are placed in the same directory. tsm_test2.py contains code examples, but requires raw Twitter data to function properly (details in the file itself).
